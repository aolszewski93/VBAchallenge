## VBAStocks
In this project, the vba script takes raw data exported from a stock program into an excel spreadsheet and gathers summary data of the stock ticker, change of value throughout the year, percent change over the year, and total stock.
It will also print out the stock with the greatest percent change, smallest percent change, and greatest amount of total stock. Basic concepts include: Conditional statements, nested loops, cell manipulation, and worksheet functions.
